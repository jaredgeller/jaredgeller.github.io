I am working on adding more content to my website, GitHub, and CodePen (see links in the footer and nav).

Exciting news - I am taking an Artificial Intelligence course at Davenport University, and will be uploading related content over time.

The first programming exercise I have completed is a programmatic solution to a provided maze.

The solution I implemented I have dubbed the "Hug Right Maze Solution", which is inspired by a technique I used to solve a corn maze in 2017.

This was my first experience with HTML5 canvas. Version 2 has some improvements and was primarily done to make it easier to modify the maze.

Here are direct links to GitHub and CodePen of the work:
