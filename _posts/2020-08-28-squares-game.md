Play the squares game, a game I made in Unity and exported to WebGL - a port of a game I originally created on a TI-83+ Silver Edition calculator in TI-BASIC in the early 2000s.

If on a mobile device, try playing in landscape mode.

Use right-click or long hold if on mobile device to toggle pattern mode.

Objective: change all white squares to black in the fewest moves possible.
